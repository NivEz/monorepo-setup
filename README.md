Adding a workspace:
1. Create a new directory named packages.
2. Inside packages create another directory for your wanted workspace.
3. Use `yarn init` or `yarn init -y` to initialize yarn.
4. Inside the `package.json` of the new package you can change the `name` field to your desired workspace name.
